            <h1 id="UK-Gambling-Industry-Spends-Millions-on-Advertising"><a href="#UK-Gambling-Industry-Spends-Millions-on-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="UK Gambling Industry Spends Millions on Advertising"></a>UK Gambling Industry Spends Millions on Advertising</h1><p>The gambling industry in the UK spends millions of pounds on advertising every year, in a bid to increase its market share.</p>
<p>Advertising by bookmakers is found all over the country, with TV adverts and large billboards often used to get their message across. The industry is thought to spend around £350 million each year on advertising, making it one of the biggest spenders in the country.</p>
<p>While there are no doubt some benefits to this level of advertising, there are also some potential downsides. For one thing, it could be argued that the advertising is too persuasive, and can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of how much advertising is actually legal. In recent years, the Advertising Standards Authority has cracked down on a number of adverts that it feels are not appropriate. This includes ads that target children or exploit people’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, the gambling industry shows no sign of stopping its spending spree on advertising. As long as profits continue to rise, we can expect to see more and more adverts encouraging us to gamble away our money.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Industry-Ramps-Up-Advertising-Spending"><a href="#Gambling-Industry-Ramps-Up-Advertising-Spending" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Industry Ramps Up Advertising Spending"></a>Gambling Industry Ramps Up Advertising Spending</h1><p>The gambling industry is seeing a sizable uptick in advertising spending as operators look to attract new customers and boost revenue.</p>
<p>According to the research firm eMarketer, global spending on gambling advertising will reach $32.9 billion this year, up from $29.9 billion last year. In 2021, the firm expects that figure to grow to $36.5 billion.</p>
<p>Much of the growth is being driven by mobile gambling, which is benefiting from the widespread adoption of smartphones and other devices. In 2019, eMarketer estimates that global spending on mobile gambling advertising will reach $11.7 billion, accounting for 36% of all gambling advertising expenditures. That figure is expected to grow to $14.7 billion by 2021, accounting for 41% of all gambling ad spending.</p>
<p> Offline gambling is also seeing significant investment in advertising. In 2021, eMarketer expects spending on traditional media such as television and radio to reach $5.5 billion, up from $4.8 billion this year. Meanwhile, online gambling is projected to see spending of $7.1 billion in 2021, up from $6.3 billion this year.</p>
<p>The growth in ad spending is being driven by a desire among casino operators to win market share amid intensifying competition both domestically and overseas. In the United States, for example, several states have recently legalized sports betting, prompting a flurry of activity among casino operators seeking to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of foreign markets are opening up to online gambling, presenting new opportunities for companies looking to expand beyond their home turf.</p>
<p>As a result, casino operators are investing heavily in advertising across all channels - TV, radio, print, digital and social media - in order to reach potential customers wherever they may be located.”</p>

In 2017, it was worth an estimated $525 billion and is expected to grow to $608 billion by 2020. Thanks to the increasing popularity of gambling, ad spending in the industry has also been on the rise.</h2><p>Ad spending in the gambling industry was just $4.8 billion in 2009, but it has since grown to more than $25 billion in 2017. This growth is expected to continue, with ad spending reaching $31.5 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>So what is driving this growth?</p>
<p>There are a number of factors at play, but one of the main drivers is the increasing number of people who are gambling. According to a report from PwC, the global gambling market will grow at a CAGR of 4.8% between 2016 and 2020. This growth is being driven by increased legalization of gambling, rising disposable incomes, and technological advancements that are making it easier for people to gamble online.</p>
<p>In addition to this, brands are also becoming increasingly savvy when it comes to marketing their products in the gambling industry. They are investing more money in advertising and using more creative methods to reach consumers. For example, they are now using social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat to target millennials who make up a large percentage of gamblers.</p>
<p>Overall, ad spending in the gambling industry is expected to continue growing at a steady rate over the next few years. This presents lucrative opportunities for brands looking to reach this audience and increase their market share.</p>
<h1 id="UK-Gambling-Firms-Spend-Millions-on-Ads"><a href="#UK-Gambling-Firms-Spend-Millions-on-Ads" class="headerlink" title="UK Gambling Firms Spend Millions on Ads"></a>UK Gambling Firms Spend Millions on Ads</h1><p>The gambling industry in the UK is booming, with firms spending millions of pounds on advertising in an effort to attract new customers.</p>
<p>According to figures from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), British gambling companies spent £5.5 million on TV ads in the first six months of 2018, up from £4.3 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>The biggest spender was Ladbrokes Coral Group, which shelled out £1.7 million on TV ads between January and June this year. GVC Holdings, the owner of Ladbrokes and a number of other betting brands, was the second-biggest advertiser, spending £1.3 million.</p>
<p>Sky Betting and Gaming was third, spending £1 million on TV ads in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>Spending by gambling companies is also rising online. In the first quarter of this year, spending on online ads by gambling firms rose by 33% compared with the same period last year, according to figures from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).</p>
<p>Gambling firms are keen to capitalise on the growing popularity of sports betting, with millions being wagered each week on matches ranging from Premier League football to horse racing.</p>
<p>The government is currently considering introducing a new tax on betting profits, which could see firms having to pay up to 25% of their revenue in taxes. However, this is unlikely to deter them from spending big on advertising in an effort to win over new customers.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Sector-Ad-Spending-to-Reach-£100-Million"><a href="#Gambling-Sector-Ad-Spending-to-Reach-£100-Million" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Sector Ad Spending to Reach £100 Million"></a>Gambling Sector Ad Spending to Reach £100 Million</h1><p>The gambling sector is forecast to spend £100 million on advertising in the next financial year, with online spending set to account for more than half of this total.</p>
<p>The news was announced by the Advertising Association, which said that the gambling sector is expected to grow by 9.5% in 2018&#x2F;19. This growth is being driven mainly by increased advertising spend on online platforms, such as social media and search engines.</p>
<p>Spending on television advertising is expected to decline in 2018&#x2F;19, with a 5% reduction in spending forecast. However, this will be offset by increases in other channels, such as online video and radio.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, ASA Chief Executive Guy Parker said: “Gambling advertising is growing fast and overtaking other forms of betting marketing. Our research shows that as people become more familiar with gambling adverts they are also more likely to gamble.”</p>
<p>The gambling sector has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with concerns being raised about the level of advertising targeting children and vulnerable adults. In March 2018, the Government launched a review into the effectiveness of current regulations governing gambling advertising.</p>
<p>The review is due to report back later this year and will consider whether further measures are needed to protect consumers from harmful gambling advertising.</p>
