Gambling is something any time the house has the odds in their support, and it's no different in Bhutan. Here, many people enjoy gambling in one form or another, be it traditional games such as archery or horse racing, or modern games played in casinos and on the internet.

The most popular form of gambling here is undoubtedly betting on horses. Horse racing has been a part of Bhutanese culture for centuries, and remains extremely popular to this day. There are numerous races held throughout the country every year, with people placing bets on both local and international races. While traditional betting methods such as using cash are still common, an increasing number of people are using online betting platforms to place their bets.

Another popular form of gambling in Bhutan is casino gaming. The first casino in Bhutan opened its doors in 2011, and there are now a handful of casinos scattered around the country. Indian rupees are the currency used in Bhutanese casinos, so non-residents need to change their currency into rupees before they can gamble. Popular casino games include blackjack, roulette, and poker.

One thing to keep in mind if you're thinking of gambling in Bhutan is that gambling is illegal for Bhutanese citizens. This means that locals are not allowed to gamble at casinos or bet on horses. So if you're looking to take part in some gambling during your time here, you'll need to do so as a foreigner.

#  Poker and gambling thriving in Bhutan

The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has a thriving underground gambling industry, much to the chagrin of the government which bans the practice.

Despite the ban, poker and other gambling games are widely played in Bhutan, with police often turning a blind eye to the activities.

Online poker has also taken off in recent years, with tens of thousands of Bhutanese logging on to play each day.

While gambling is technically illegal in Bhutan, there is no law that specifically targets it, leaving police and prosecutors reluctant to act.

"Gambling is rampant in rural areas. It's an open secret," said Thinley Dorji, a social worker in Trongsa district. "The authorities don't care because it's not officially banned."

Officials say they would like to stamp out gambling but have more pressing priorities. "There are many more important issues to deal with than chasing after gamblers," said Kinzang Dorji, spokesman for the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs.

Gambling is popular in many parts of the world, but is especially prevalent in Asia where casinos are often found in close proximity to each other.

In neighboring India, gambling is widespread, with millions of people betting on cricket matches, horse races and other events. It is estimated that around $60 billion is wagered each year in India on gambling activities.

There have also been cases where someone has lost all their money playing cards or dice and has had to sell their livestock or land to pay off their debts. However, these cases are rare and most people view gambling as a harmless form of entertainment.
