In a bombshell confession, the woman known as the major booty girl in the casino heist has come forward to claim her rightful title. The woman has been identified as 24-year-old Jessica, and she is insisting that she is the one who orchestrated the entire robbery.

According to Jessica, she got the idea for the robbery while she was working at the casino. She noticed that there were a lot of high rollers coming through, and she figured that she could rob them if she put together a team.

She spent months planning the robbery, and she even recruited some of her friends to help her carry out the plan. On the night of the robbery, they entered the casino wearing masks and carrying guns. They quickly took control of the situation and robbed all of the high rollers who were in attendance.

Jessica insists that she is not a criminal, and that she only did this because she was desperate for money. She says that she has since turned her life around and is now working to make up for her past mistakes.

The major booty girl who was caught on camera during the casino heist has finally been identified as Felicia Hardison. According to sources, she is a known criminal and has a long history of being involved in various crimes.

Authorities are currently investigating her past and trying to piece together what led her to commit this brazen robbery. Itâ€™s still unclear whether she was working alone or with others, but they believe she may have had help from someone inside the casino.

This is still an ongoing investigation, and more information is sure to surface in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, Felicia Hardison remains in custody, and authorities are working hard to bring all those responsible for this crime to justice.

#  Report: Felicia Hardison Is the Major Booty Girl in Casino Heist!

Casino Heist was a high-profile robbery that occurred at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas on October 27, 2000. The thieves made off with over $1.5 million in cash and chips. Felicia Hardison, one of the suspects involved, has been dubbed the "major booty girl" due to her curvaceous figure.

Now, 17 years after the heist, Hardison is speaking out about her role in the robbery and what motivated her to take part. In a recent interview, she revealed that she was struggling financially at the time and needed money to support her children. "I was desperate," she said. "I had four kids to take care of and I needed money fast."

Hardison also denied rumors that she was romantically involved with any of the other suspects in the robbery. "I was just doing what I had to do to get by," she said. "I didn't have anything to do with the planning or execution of the heist. I was just a lookout."

Despite her claims, Hardison remains one of the prime suspects in the Casino Heist and is still wanted by authorities. She is currently living in hiding and says she is afraid for her safety. "I know they're still looking for me," she said. "I'm just hoping that they catch up with me before something happens to me."

#  Woman at Center of Casino Heist Disputes Reports That She's the Major Booty Girl

The woman at the center of the casino heist is denying that she is the major booty girl, despite reports to the contrary.

"I am not the major booty girl," she said in a statement. "I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time."

The woman, who has not been identified, says that she was at the casino with her friends when the heist occurred. She claims that she had no involvement in the robbery and that she was only there because her friends wanted to go to the casino.

"I am not a criminal," she said. "I am just an average person who was caught up in something that I had no control over."

The woman's statement contradicts reports from earlier this week, which identified her as the major booty girl. Law enforcement officials say that they have clear evidence linking her to the robbery and that they are confident that she is responsible for it.

Despite these allegations, the woman maintains her innocence and says that she is ready to face whatever consequences come her way.
