#  How Much Does A Tie Pay In Baccarat? 

A great question for anyone looking to play baccarat is how much does a tie pay in the game. The answer may surprise some people. In most casinos, a tie will only pay out 8 to 1.

There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to bet on a tie. First, the chances of winning are relatively low, so it is important to make sure that you are comfortable with this before placing any bets. Second, because the payout is relatively low, it is important to make sure that your potential rewards are worth the risk. Finally, always be sure to read the rules and regulations of the casino where you are playing, as they may vary from place to place.
