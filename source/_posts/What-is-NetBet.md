# What Types of Bets Can I Place?

You can place three types of bets at NetBet: singles, accumulators, and system bets. Singles are just what they sound like: single bets on one outcome. An accumulator is a series of singles bets that are all combined into one bet. And system bets allow you to combine multiple selections into a single bet that covers every possible outcome.

#  What is Pound?

Pound is a software development tool that enables developers to write code that is both maintainable and scalable. It does this by breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier for developers to understand and work with, which in turn leads to better-quality code.

One of Pound's key features is its ability to enforce a strict separation of concerns. This means that each part of the code is responsible for just one thing, and nothing more. This helps to avoid problems such as code duplication, which can be difficult to track down and fix.

Another advantage of Pound is that it encourages modularity. Modules are self-contained pieces of code that can be easily reused in other projects. This not only speeds up the development process, but also helps to ensure consistency across different applications.

Due to its many benefits, Pound has become a popular choice among developers worldwide. It is used by companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, as well as by many open source projects.
