#  If Meadowlands Gets Sports Betting, Ku Casino Could Benefit

New Jersey's victory in the Supreme Court to allow sports betting could have a significant impact on the Meadowlands Racetrack.

"There is no question that the Meadowlands will benefit from sports betting," said Dennis Drazin, who operates Monmouth Park Racetrack and the Garden State Gaming Commission. "I would expect it to be one of the biggest racetracks in the country."

Ku Casino, located at the Meadowlands and adjacent to the racetrack, could also see a surge in business. Operated by Boyd Gaming, Ku Casino offers 680 slot machines and 34 table games. It has struggled to attract customers since it opened in late 2016, but with legal sports betting available, that could change.

"Our casino is really looking forward to offering sports betting," said Ken Afflerbach, regional president of Boyd Gaming. "We believe it will be a popular amenity with our guests."

The New Jersey casinos are not the only ones that could benefit from sports betting. NFL stadiums could also see a boost in revenue from concessions and other related businesses. For example, Delaware Park Racetrack & Slots generated an extra $1 million in revenue during its first month of legalized sports betting.

#  NJ Meadowlands Could Get Its Own Sportsbook If Sports Gambling Becomes legal

The New Jersey Meadowlands Racetrack could become the home of the state's first sportsbook if sports gambling is legalized.

Penn National, which owns the Meadowlands Racetrack, has submitted a proposal to the New Jersey Racing Commission that would allow the company to operate a sportsbook at the track.

"If sports betting is legalized in New Jersey, Penn National Gaming wants to be ready to offer this amenity to our guests at the Meadowlands Racetrack," said Jeffrey Gural, chairman of Penn National Gaming.

If approved, the Meadowlands would be one of six racetracks in New Jersey with a sportsbook. The other five are Monmouth Park, Freehold Raceway, Oceanport Racecourse, The Great America Raceway and harness racing track Tioga Downs.

Sports gambling is currently illegal in New Jersey, but the state is seeking to overturn that ban as a way to help bolster its flagging casino industry. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had banned gambling on most sporting events nationwide.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize some form of sports gambling. Delaware and West Virginia have already begun allowing bets on individual sporting events, while New York and Pennsylvania are considering similar measures.

#  Meadowlands Proposal Includes Plans for On-Site Sports Betting, Ku Casino partnership 

New Jersey Representatives, including Senator Raymond Lesniak and Assemblyman Vincent Prieto, today announced a proposal for the Meadowlands Sports Complex that would include an on-site sports betting facility and a partnership with the Ku Casino.

"This is a great day for the people of New Jersey," said Senator Lesniak. "We are finally able to offer our residents the same world-class entertainment and gaming options as our neighbors in New York and Pennsylvania."

The proposal also includes plans for renovation of the existing complex, which would be used to house the sports betting operation, as well as a new hotel, restaurant, and event center. The Ku Casino would be responsible for operating the sports betting facility.

"This is an excellent opportunity for us to bring our world-class gaming experience to New Jersey," said Ku Casino CEO Tony Liu. "We are looking forward to working with the state government to make this proposal a reality."

The Meadowlands proposal is one of several being considered by the state government as it moves to expand gaming options in New Jersey. Other proposals include plans for new casinos in Atlantic City and Bergen County.

#  NJ Considering Allowing Meadowlands Ku Casino to Operate Sportsbook

The New Jersey Legislature is considering a new bill that would allow the Meadowlands Ku Casino to operate a sportsbook. The move could provide a big boost to the casino, which has seen dwindling revenues in recent years.

The Meadowlands Ku Casino has been looking for ways to increase revenue since it opened in 2013. The casino is located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and has struggled to attract customers since it opened.

One of the main attractions at the Meadowlands Ku Casino is its sportsbook. However, state regulations currently prohibit the casino from operating a sportsbook.

That could soon change thanks to a new bill that is being considered by the New Jersey Legislature. The bill would allow the Meadowlands Ku Casino to operate a sportsbook, giving it a major competitive advantage over other casinos in the state.

The move could be a major boon for the casino, which has seen its revenues decline in recent years. In 2017, the casino generated $181 million in revenue, down from $203 million in 2016.

Operating a sportsbook could help offset those declines and help the casino become more profitable. It’s also likely to attract more customers to the casino, which could help reverse its fortunes.

The bill is still under consideration by the New Jersey Legislature and has not yet been approved. If it does pass, it’s likely that the Meadowlands Ku Casino will be one of the first casinos in New Jersey to offer a sportsbook.

#  Meadowlands Officials Eyeing Potential Ku Casino Partnership for Sports Betting

The partnership would allow the casino to offer sports betting services and could help the state of New Jersey to generate more revenue.

Meadowlands Racetrack officials are in early talks with the nearby Ku Casino about a potential partnership that would allow the casino to offer sports betting services, according to reports. The move could be a major boon for the state of New Jersey, which is still waiting for a Supreme Court decision on its 2018 bid to legalize sports betting.

It’s not clear yet what form the potential partnership would take or how much revenue it could generate for Meadowlands Racetrack and the state of New Jersey, but officials believe that a deal could be reached by the end of 2019. In addition to Meadowlands Racetrack, other casinos in Atlantic City are also eyeing potential partnerships with local racinos and horse tracks to offer sports betting services.

The potential partnership comes as no surprise, as both Meadowlands Racetrack and Ku Casino are owned by Meruelo Group, one of the largest gaming companies in the United States. Meruelo Group has already partnered with several other racinos and casinos in other states to offer sports betting services, so it makes sense that they would try to do the same in New Jersey.

Sports betting is a big business, and analysts estimate that it could generate as much as $1 billion in annual revenue for New Jersey. That’s a major incentive for Meadowlands Racetrack and Ku Casino to work together, and it will be interesting to see how their negotiations progress over the coming months.
