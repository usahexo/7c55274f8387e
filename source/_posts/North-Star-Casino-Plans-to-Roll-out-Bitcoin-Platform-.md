#  North Star Casino to Add Bitcoin Functionality in Upcoming Rollout 

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are continuing to surge in popularity, with more businesses and organizations looking to add the functionality into their services. North Star Casino is the latest to announce their plans to rollout Bitcoin support, which will allow customers to use the cryptocurrency for gambling and gaming purposes.

The addition of Bitcoin as a payment option is part of North Star Casino's larger goal to make their site more user-friendly and convenient for customers. In addition to Bitcoin, the casino also plans to add support for other cryptocurrencies in the near future.

This move by North Star Casino comes as no surprise, as the cryptocurrency has seen a meteoric rise in value over the past year or so. As of this writing, a single Bitcoin is worth roughly $10,000USD, up from just a few hundred dollars just one year ago.

With the value of Bitcoin continuing to increase, it's no wonder that businesses are looking to add it into their systems. Cryptocurrencies offer an easy way for customers to transfer money without having to go through traditional banking and financial institutions. This can save both time and money for customers, which is why many are turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a preferred payment method.

The rollout of Bitcoin support by North Star Casino is sure to be popular among gamers and gamblers alike. With the value of Bitcoin only expected to increase further in the coming years, it's likely that other businesses will follow suit and add similar functionality into their own services.
