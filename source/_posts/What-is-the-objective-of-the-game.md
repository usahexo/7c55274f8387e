# How do you play?

At the beginning of the game, each player is given a set number of pieces, which are placed on their home territory. The player with the most pieces starts first. On a turn, a player can either move one of their pieces or attack an opponents piece. If a piece is moved into an opponent’s territory, it captures any enemy pieces inside and takes control of that territory. If an opponent’s piece is attacked, it is captured and removed from the board. The game ends when one player either captures all of their opponent’s pieces or controls all of the territories on the game board. The player with the most points wins the game.
