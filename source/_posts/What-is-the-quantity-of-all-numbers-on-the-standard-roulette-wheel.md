In roulette, a standard wheel has 36 slots numbered from 1 to 36. The sequence of numbers on the wheel is strictly random, so any given number has the same chance of being selected as any other number.

This means that there is a 1 in 36 chance of any given number being selected. This also means that there are 35 other numbers on the wheel that have a 1 in 36 chance of being selected.

To calculate the quantity of all numbers on the standard roulette wheel, we simply multiply 1 by 36 and 35 by 36. This gives us a total quantity of 1296 numbers on the standard roulette wheel.

#  What is the range of all numbers on the standard roulette wheel?

A roulette wheel has 36 numbers in total, which are evenly distributed between 1 and 36. This means that each number has an equal probability of appearing when the wheel is spun.
